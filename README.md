# tpc_alignment_data
raw files for TPC alignment
OGP contains the data from the OGP scans of the central membrane petals.  .DAT files are detailed outlines, in global coordinates, of all stripes on the petal, while .txt files are a separate survey of the centers and areas of each petal.  The first four places surveyed in each pattern are the survey marks themselves, which are silver circles with black outlines.  The circles are irregular on this scale.
